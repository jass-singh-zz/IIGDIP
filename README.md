Image Improvisation using Gradient Descent and Image Processing 

*Image improvisation is strenuous both on front of software and human.*
*This project implements image improvisation methods such as applying the smudging effect (similar to DSLR effect), gray scaling the background etc.*
*Using the image processing concepts several image filters have been proposed which would provide user with additional functionality of enhanced images.*
*Also providing efficient results without indulging user.*

This repository contains code for GUI and screenshots reagarding working of project.
It includes sample input and output (*images with applied Smudgy effect*) images.

## Types of filters implemented :
1. Object Detection (*Object_Detection_Module.m*)
2. Grayscale Bakckground (*Grayscale_Back_Module.m*)
3. Eye Filter (*Eye_Filter_Module.m*)
4. Color Filter (*Color_Detection_Module.m*)
5. People Detection (*Person_Detect_Module.m*)
6. Smudgy filter (*Smudgy_Module.m*)
7. Submerged Image (*Submerged_Module.m*)
